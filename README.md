# voice-interactive-ai
This project is a web application where I implemented a simple AI that allows users to interact with it using voice commands. The AI processes spoken input and responds accordingly, creating an intuitive and hands-free experience.

## Technologies used:

- React.js: For building the user interface and managing the appâ€™s state.
- react-speech-kit: For integrating speech synthesis and enabling the AI to speak back to the user.
- react-speech-recognition: For enabling voice recognition, allowing users to communicate with the AI via speech.
- EdenAI: For connecting to various AI models and enhancing the conversational capabilities of the app.

This project demonstrates my skills in integrating voice-based interactions into web applications, leveraging React and modern AI technologies.
